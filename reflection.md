# 3.5 Your Website, part 3 (Solo Challenge) - Reflection

---
[Here is a link to my live website](http://angelikayoder.github.io/)

1. *What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?*
>I found that very frequently, when I can't position one of those the way I want or where I want, it's because one of them is affecting the other and I should check them all to make sure.
**margin-** a margin is the space that goes around the outside of an element (outer space).  
**border-** a border area around the content (contains the space).
**padding-** is the space between the content and the border (inner space).

2. *What did you learn about CSS positioning?*
>I found the *fixed positioning* to be the easiest to use because things stuck where I stuck them. It's probably not best practice. The most difficult for me was the *relative positioning* mainly because it required so much forethought into what the final result would be.</br>
**Absolute positioning-** The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element.  
**Fixed positioning-** The element is positioned relative to the browser window. Right or wrong, my pair used fixed positioning to anchor certain fixtures to their place: like an element we wanted to use as a header or footer. Also, we anchored one of the squares to it's position in order to make the rest of the squares relative to the first squares position thus, distributing them evenly after the first square (probaly not best practice).  
**Static positioning-** Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow.  
**Relative positioning-** The element is positioned relative to its normal position. As I cited in my "fixed positioning" definition, we made several squares all relative to the position squares before them in order to space them out evenly.  

3. *What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?*
>I found adding "id's" to various elements such as div tags to be the easiest while designing. I found positioning to be the hardest since things never seem to end up where I intended, always a bit off.

4. *What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?*
>I learned a lot about "rabbit-holing". It's now a verb if it wasn't before. Oh, how I want to keep going and going and tweaking and manipulating all the live-long day! And my website still looks deplorable but, I had to cut myself off or else I'd be up all night. Oh my, I just realized its 2am! Also, I learned a lot has changed since my blogging days back in the early 2000's when CSS was so easy and simple to manipulate. The choices available to me now are extensive and new. I learned to love adding "id" and "class" to so many things when I need to customize them.
