      <h2>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h2>
      <h4>January 3, 2016</h4>
      <h5>Overview</h5>

      <p>How do we access information from Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects?
        JavaScript(JS) and Ruby are both great tools for creating and managing
        collections of related information as well as being pretty easy to use. How do
        they stack up to each other?</p>

      <p>The definish for a hash in ruby-doc.org, "... a Hash is a collection of unique keys
        and their values. They are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses
        integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type." For
        additional description and a good example of a Ruby hash, see my previous
        blog post Arrays and Hashes.</p>

      <p>Similarly, Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) states "a JavaScript object
        is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between
        a name (or key) and a value. Also, a property's value can be a function,
        in which case the property is known as a method."</p>

      <p>Not only are their definitions strikingly similar, the means by which they
        are created is practically identical:</p>

      <h5>How to create a new hash in Ruby</h5>

      <p><code> grades = {"Jane Doe": 10, "Jim Doe": 6 }</code></p>

      <h5>How to create a new object in JS</h5>

      <p><code>var grades = {"Jane Doe": 10, "Jim Doe": 6};</code></p>

        <h5>Hash keys and their property names</h5>

        <p>Property names for JS and Ruby keys both must be unique. However, JS
          object properties are "just ordinary variables, except for their attachment
          to objects" (MDN).</p>

          <p>However, hash keys in Ruby can be almost anything including; symbols,
            strings, numbers, arrays, and/or even other hashes.

            <h5>Values</h5>

            <p>Ruby hash and JS object property values can be almost anything.
              In fact, a JS property values can be other objects, or it could be
               a function.</p>

  <h5>Accessing information</h5>

  <p>Although very similar, there are still some differences in how we access
    the stored information in key/value and property/value pairs. While using Ruby,
    accessing hash values is easy if the name of the key if the name of the key/value
    is known.
    For example:
    <p><code> hash[key] => returns value</code></p>
    <p><code>hash.key(value) => returns key</code></p>

  <p>It's also easy to access property values in JS using one of two ways.
    The two formats are called "dot notation" and "bracket notation".
    They look like this:</p>
    <p><code> object.name => returns value</code></p>
    <p><code>object["name"] => returns value</code></p>

    <p>It could be said that using "dot notation" is best practice whenever possible,
      possibly because it's more succinct and easier to read. However, bracket
      notation isn't without merit. For example, property names with spaces in them
      can be accessed as well as generating property names. For example:</p>
      <p><code> object["key two"] => returns value of property "key two"</code></p>
      <p><code>object["key" + 3] => returns value of property "key3"</code></p>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>

  <p>This is only an introduction into the potentially infinate ways JS and ruby
      hashes/objects can be used to power your websites. The ruby-docs and MDN
      are go-to resources for the industry and provide a lot more info on <thead>
      topic.</p>
