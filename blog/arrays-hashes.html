  <h4>December 2015</h4>

  <br>
    <p>New to programming and trying to learn the difference between an array and a hash and perhaps when to use each? Below, you'll find a breakdown to help you figure it out.</p>
    <p>Hashes are another example of a data structure, and like arrays they are one of the most commonly used data structures in programming.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Arrays</h4>
    <p>Programs need to do repetitive things very quickly.Arrays are very useful.You can go through the elements of an array in order or, you can use numbers to "index" into a array, meaning you can use numbers to find out what's in arrays.</p>
    <p>When to Use Arrays?</p>
    <br>
    <p>You use an array whenever you have something that matches the array data structure's features:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you need to maintain order. Remember, this is listed order, not sorted order. Arrays do not sort for you.</li>
        <li>If you need to access the contents randomly by a number. Remember, this is using cardinal numbers starting at 0.</li>
        <li> If you need to go through the contents linearly (first to last). Remember, that's what for-loops are for. Then that's when you use an array.</li></ul>

  <br>
  <br>
    <h4>Hashes</h4>
    <br>
       <p> Ruby calls them "hashes", which is short for "hashmaps." Other languages call them "dictionaries."</p>
       <br>
       <p>You use a hash when:
         <br>
         <ul>
       <li>You have to retrieve things based on some identifier, like names, addresses, or anything that can be a key.</li>
       <li>You don't need things to be in order. Hashes do not normally have any notion of order, so you have to use an array for that.</li>
       <li>You are going to be adding and removing elements and their keys.</li>
       <li>This means that if you have to use a non-numeric key, use a hash. If you need things in order, use an array.</li>
        </ul>
       <br>
       <p> A hash is used to map or associate things you want to store to keys you need to get them. A hash lets you use anything, not just numbers, as your index. A hash associates one thing to another, no matter what it is.</p>
       instead of just numbers, you use strings to say what you want. You can put new things into the hash with strings as well. You aren't limited to strings for keys or values.
       Mapping and associating are key concepts in a hash.</p>
