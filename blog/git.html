    <p>What are the benefits of version control? Developers use version control to be able to work within a team on the same code, be able to track changes (who did what, when, and accompanying notes all saved with consistent nomenclature), merge changes, have a backup of code in case of catastrophe, revert to previous versions if need be.
</p>
    <p>How does git help you keep track of changes? It forces standardized nomenclature, branching to work on items instead of directly in the main branch to reduce critical fails and allows many to work on the same files without stepping on other coders toes.</p>
    <p>Why use GitHub to store your code? It can be accessed from anywhere, anytime and by several users at once as opposed to something that is worked on only in a local enviroment, accessible only from that machine, one user at a time.</p>
